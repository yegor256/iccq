  * Importance: The paper contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the field. We also welcome papers that diverge from the dominant trajectory of the field.

  * Evidence: The paper presents sufficient evidence supporting its claims, such as proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, case studies, and anecdotes.

  * Clarity: The paper presents its contributions, methodology and results clearly.

Papers will be reviewed by at least three [PC](#pc) members using
a [double-blind review](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/social-science-and-medicine/policies/double-blind-peer-review-guidelines) process.
