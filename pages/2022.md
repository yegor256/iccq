The general research interest of Dr. Zhang centers around the use of 
both static and dynamic programming analysis techniques for making 
complex software systems more secure and reliable. Dr. Zhang is 
an Associate Professor and director of the 
[Cybersecurity Lab](http://cybersecurity.cse.ust.hk/) at [HKUST](http://www.cs.ust.hk/). 
His research received an [ICSE](http://www.icse-conferences.org/) and a 
[PLDI](https://conf.researchr.org/home/pldi-2021) distinguished paper award, 
as well as the [ACM SIGSOFT](https://www.sigsoft.org) 
Doctoral Dissertation Award, and IBM PhD fellowships. 
He co-founded and served as the chairman of [Sourcebrella](https://www.sourcebrella.com/),

## Keynotes and Invited Talks # {#keynotes}

**Enterprise-scale static analysis: A Pinpoint experience**
[Charles Zhang](http://www.cs.ust.hk/~charlesz/)
{: .accepted}

Despite years of research and practice, modern static analysis techniques still cannot detect oldest and extremely well understood software bugs such as the Heartbleed, one of the most “spectacular” security flaws of the recent decade. A remedy, as what we have attempted through the successful commercialization of the Pinpoint platform (PLDI 18), is to make static program analysis aware of the basic characteristics of the modern enterprise-scale software system. The talk focuses on discussing these characteristics and how Pinpoint addresses them pragmatically as well as its future directions. Pinpoint is a LLVM-based cross-language static analysis platform and deployed in major Chinese tech companies such as Tencent, Baidu, Huawei, and Alibaba.

## Call for Papers # {#cfp}

Papers will be published in the _Proceedings of ICCQ_
and submitted for inclusion into
[ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/)
subject to meeting their scope and quality requirements;
to be indexed by
[Web of Science](https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/web-of-science/),
[Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/home.uri),
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/),
[DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/), and others.

Publishing fee is <del>$699</del> free, thanks to our sponsors.

We consider the following criteria when evaluating papers:

  * Novelty: The paper presents new ideas and results and places them appropriately within the context established by previous research.

  * Importance: The paper contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the field. We also welcome papers that diverge from the dominant trajectory of the field.

  * Evidence: The paper presents sufficient evidence supporting its claims, such as proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, case studies, and anecdotes.

  * Clarity: The paper presents its contributions, methodology and results clearly.

Papers will be reviewed by at least three [PC](#pc) members using
a [double-blind review](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/social-science-and-medicine/policies/double-blind-peer-review-guidelines) process.

A PDF version of the CFP can be found [here](https://latexonline.cc/compile?git=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fyegor256%2Ficcq.github.io&target=cfp%2F2022%2Fcfp.tex&command=pdflatex&trackId=1590577068733).

## Student Research Competition # {#src}

The competition provides visibility and exposes up-and-coming researchers 
to the computer science community. On top of that, the competition
gives students an opportunity to receive a monetary support from
a leading tech company, motivating them to continue the study.

This year the competition is sponsored by 
[Huawei RRI](https://career.huawei.ru/rri/).

You must be BSc, MSc, or PhD student
in any university in Russia:

  1. You pick a research question from the list below;

  2. You research it and publish your results in any 
  conference or a journal sponsored by 
  [ACM](https://www.acm.org) or [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org);

  3. You [email](mailto:src@iccq.ru) us a link to your published paper
  before the 15th of March, 2022;

  4. We let our judges appraise it;

  5. We announce winners on the day of the conference;

  6. Best papers get monetary rewards from our prize fund, 
  which is **$30,000** this year.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of research questions we expect you to
try finding answers for:

  * Can computers write code better than humans?

  * How source code can be refactored automatically (maybe using Machine Learning)?

  * How existing static analysis methods and tools can be improved?

  * How the process of coding via IDE can be optimized to increase the quality of code?

  * Can new programming techniques decrease the number of bugs humans make in the code?

  * Is it possible to objectively measure software quality?

  * Can some coding practices be formally proved to be harmful?

These people are the judges:

  * [Giancarlo Succi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PdMO57sAAAAJ&hl=en), Innopolis University
<!--  * [Qianxiang Wang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37278378900), Huawei-->

We are still building the committee, the list will be extended soon.
