<br/>
Innopolis, Kazan, Russia

The Second **I**nternational **C**onference on **C**ode **Q**uality (ICCQ)
is a one-day computer science event
focused on static analysis, program verification,
bug detection, and software maintenance.

This year there is also a [Student Research Competition](/src.html)
with monetary rewards.

Last year we were hosted by HSE in Moscow: [ICCQ 2021](/2021.html).

## Call for Papers # {#cfp}

Papers will be published in the _Proceedings of ICCQ_.
<!--
and submitted for inclusion into
[IEEE Xplore®](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp)
subject to meeting their scope and quality requirements;
to be indexed by
[Web of Science](https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/web-of-science/),
[Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/home.uri),
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/),
[DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/), and others.
-->

Publishing fee is $699.

We consider the following criteria when evaluating papers:

  * Novelty: The paper presents new ideas and results and places them appropriately within the context established by previous research.

  * Importance: The paper contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the field. We also welcome papers that diverge from the dominant trajectory of the field.

  * Evidence: The paper presents sufficient evidence supporting its claims, such as proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, case studies, and anecdotes.

  * Clarity: The paper presents its contributions, methodology and results clearly.

Papers will be reviewed by at least three [PC](#pc) members using
a [double-blind review](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/social-science-and-medicine/policies/double-blind-peer-review-guidelines) process.

A PDF version of the CFP can be found [here](https://latexonline.cc/compile?git=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fyegor256%2Ficcq.github.io&target=cfp%2F2022%2Fcfp.tex&command=pdflatex&trackId=1590577068733).

## Student Research Competition # {#src}

The competition provides visibility and exposes up-and-coming researchers 
to the computer science community. On top of that, the competition
gives students an opportunity to receive a monetary support from
a leading tech company, motivating them to continue the study.

This year the competition is sponsored by 
[Huawei RRI](https://career.huawei.ru/rri/).

You must be BSc, MSc, or PhD student
in any university in Russia:

  1. You pick a research question from the list below;

  2. You research it and publish your results in any 
  conference or a journal sponsored by 
  [ACM](https://www.acm.org) or [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org);

  3. You [email](mailto:src@iccq.ru) us a link to your published paper
  before the 15th of March, 2022;

  4. We let our judges appraise it;

  5. We announce winners on the day of the conference;

  6. Best papers get monetary rewards from our prize fund, 
  which is **$30,000** this year.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of research questions we expect you to
try finding answers for:

  * Can computers write code better than humans?

  * How source code can be refactored automatically (maybe using Machine Learning)?

  * How existing static analysis methods and tools can be improved?

  * How the process of coding via IDE can be optimized to increase the quality of code?

  * Can new programming techniques decrease the number of bugs humans make in the code?

  * Is it possible to objectively measure software quality?

  * Can some coding practices be formally proved to be harmful?

These people are the judges:

  * [Giancarlo Succi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PdMO57sAAAAJ&hl=en), Innopolis University
<!--  * [Qianxiang Wang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37278378900), Huawei-->

We are still building the committee, the list will be extended soon.
