## How to Become a Partner

ICCQ is making an attempt to put together best scientists
working in the area of code quality analysis. The event is organized
and sponsored by a few famous academic organizations in Russia, including
[Higher School of Economics](https://www.hse.ru) and [Innopolis University](https://innopolis.university/).

ICCQ is interested in seeing Russian academic, not-for-profit, and commercial
organizations as our partners. If you, as much as we are,
concerned about the quality of code software developers write nowadays,
please [email us](mailto:partners@iccq.ru) and we will discuss
how exactly you can help us make the event even better. 

This is what we expect from our partners. 
**Required**: 
   * Let us share the information about our partnership
    on this website. We expect a horizontally alligned logo of your company and
    a short description (10-15 words) of your company's main business. See [partners](https://www.iccq.ru/2022.html#partners).

**Optional (the following points are not required, but we appriciate your help)**:
  * Distribute information about ICCQ among those who
    may potentially become our speakers or our listeners inside of your comapny.
    For commercial organizations we expect the spread of the information among employees
    (internal e-mails about the conference, banners, internal boards);
    
  * Distribute information about the conference in your social media using your corporate accounts;

  * Suggest one person (PhDs are welcome) from your organization to become
    a member of our Program Committee or a Speaker at the conference;

  * Attend the event (you will get 4 free passes) and present your company; 

Thanks for helping us!
