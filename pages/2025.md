Papers will be published in the _Proceedings of ICCQ_
and submitted for inclusion into
[IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp)
subject to meeting their scope and quality requirements;
to be indexed by
[Web of Science](https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/web-of-science/),
[Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/home.uri),
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/),
[DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/), and others.

Publishing is free of charge.

We consider the following criteria when evaluating papers:

  * Novelty: The paper presents new ideas and results and places them appropriately within the context established by previous research.

  * Importance: The paper contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the field. We also welcome papers that diverge from the dominant trajectory of the field.

  * Evidence: The paper presents sufficient evidence supporting its claims, such as proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, case studies, and anecdotes.

  * Clarity: The paper presents its contributions, methodology and results clearly.

Papers will be reviewed by at least three [PC](#pc) members using
a [double-blind review](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/social-science-and-medicine/policies/double-blind-peer-review-guidelines) process.
