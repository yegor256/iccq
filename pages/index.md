Security has become a central and unavoidable aspect of
today’s software development. Practitioners and researchers
have proposed many code analysis tools and techniques to
mitigate security risks. These tools apply static and dynamic
analysis or, more recently, machine learning. Machine learning models can achieve impressive results in finding and
forecasting possible security issues in programs. However,
there are at least two areas where most of the current approaches fall short of developer demands: explainability and
granularity of predictions.
In this paper, we propose a novel and simple yet, promising approach to identify potentially vulnerable source code
in JavaScript programs. The model improves the state-of-the-art in terms of explainability and prediction granularity
as it gives results at the level of individual source code lines,
which is fine-grained enough for developers to take immediate actions. Additionally, the model explains each predicted
line (i.e., provides the most similar vulnerable line from the
training set) using a prototype-based approach. In a study of
186 real-world and confirmed JavaScript vulnerability fixes
of 91 projects, the approach could flag 60% of the known
vulnerable lines on average by marking only 10% of the
code-base, but in certain cases the model identified 100% of
the vulnerable code lines while flagging only 8.72% of the
code-base.

**An Efficient Dynamic Analysis Tool for Checking Durable Linearizability**

{: .accepted}

Designing efficient and correct durable data structures
is indispensable because Non-Volatile Memory (NVM)
is positioned as a successor to DRAM due to its energy
efficiency and reliability. The challenge with ensuring
correctness for efficient durable data structures is that
caches and registers are expected to remain volatile, and
the explicit cache line flush and barrier instructions are
expensive. As a result cache line flushes and barriers
are used sparingly, leading to potential inconsistencies
in the recoverable state of the data structure. Crash
consistency tools are available to ensure recoverability to a consistent state, but these tools are not able to
check correctness of data structure semantics. Furthermore, the formal logic proposed to verify correctness
conditions such as durable linearizability involve labor
intensive mechanical proofs using a theorem prover.
In this paper, we present the first dynamic analysis
tool that checks durable linearizability at runtime. Our
proposed tool, VSV-D, uses a vector space analysis to
achieve a worst-case 𝑂(𝑛<sup>2</sup>) time complexity. We extend the analysis to transactional correctness to enable
VSV-D to check durable transactional data structures.
Our experimental evaluation applies VSV-D to check
the correctness of a large variety of durable data structures including log-free data structures, link-free data
structures, Romulus, OneFile, PMDK, and PETRA.

**Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of Callgraph Algorithms for PYTHON**

{: .accepted}

As one of the most popular programming languages, Python has
become a relevant target language for static analysis tools. The
primary data structure for performing an inter-procedural static
analysis is callgraph (CG), which links call sites to potential call targets in a program. There exists multiple algorithms for constructing
callgraphs, tailored to specific languages. However, comparatively
few implementations target Python. Moreover, there is still lack
of empirical evidence as to how these few algorithms perform in
terms of precision and recall.
This paper thus presents eval_CG, an extensible framework for
comparative analysis of Python callgraphs. We conducted two
experiments which run the CG algorithms on different Python
programming constructs and real-world applications. In both experiments, we evaluate three CG generation frameworks namely,
Code2flow, Pyan, and Wala. We record precision, recall, and running time, and identify sources of unsoundness of each framework.
Our evaluation shows that none of the current CG construction
frameworks produce a sound CG. Moreover, the static CGs contain many spurious edges. Code2flow is also comparatively slow.
Hence, further research is needed to support CG generation for
Python programs

**Exploring the Effect of NULL Usage in Source Code**
[Ekaterina Garmash](https://scholar.google.ru/citations?user=x79aj7sAAAAJ) and Anton Cheshkov
{: .accepted}

In this paper we propose a methodology to reason about
code smells, or anti-patterns, using causal inference (CI).
We specifically focus on one notorious case of code smells,
the usage of NULL. CI provides methods to estimate the
magnitude of effect of certain actions on some target value
from observational data only. Applying the methods to the
domain of software engineering, we would like to estimate
the average effect of using a certain pattern on some characterization of code quality. If code quality systematically
deteriorates when a certain pattern is used, it can serve as
empirical confirmation that it is in fact an anti-pattern. We
narrow down the problem and study the effect of using a
selection of NULL-based patterns on code complexity metrics. The experiments on open source Java code show preliminary confirmation that NULL is in fact an anti-pattern,
but the results are not always consistent. We think that the
main reason for such inconclusive results is the fact that
our underlying causal model is too simplistic. As the next
step of our follow-up research, we will work on improving
the causal model. We believe that this can be a promising
line of research towards building an explanatory theory of
software engineering, since it does not rely on expensive
controlled experiments with human experts and can make
use of abundant open source observational data resources,
such as Github.

**Striffs: Architectural Component Diagrams for Code Reviews**
[Muntazir Fadhel](http://mfadhel.com/)
and
Emil Sekerinski
{: .accepted}

Despite recent advancements in automated code quality
and defect finding tools, developers spend a significant
amount of time completing code reviews. Code understandability is a key contributor to this phenomenon,
since engineers need to understand both microscopic
and macroscopic level details of the code under review.
Existing tools for code reviews including diffing, inline
commenting and syntax highlighting provide limited
support for the macroscopic understanding needs of
reviewers. When reviewing code for architectural and
design quality, such tools do not enable reviewers to
understand the code from a top-down lens which the
original architects of the code would have likely used to
design the system. To overcome these limitations and
to complement existing approaches, we introduce structure diff (striff) diagrams. Striffs provide reviewers with
an architectural understanding of the incoming code in
relation to the existing system, allowing reviewers to
gain a more complete view of the scope and impact of
the proposed code changes in a code review.

**Raising Security Awareness using Cybersecurity Challenges in Embedded Programming Courses**

Security bugs are errors in code that, when exploited, can
lead to serious software vulnerabilities. These bugs could
allow an attacker to take over an application and steal information. One of the ways to address this issue is by means
of awareness training. The Sifu platform was developed in
the industry, for the industry, with the aim to raise software
developers’ awareness of secure coding. This paper extends
the Sifu platform with three challenges that specifically address embedded programming courses, and describes how
to implement these challenges, while also evaluating the
usefulness of these challenges to raise security awareness
in an academic setting. Our work presents technical details
on the detection mechanisms for software vulnerabilities
and gives practical advice on how to implement them. The
evaluation of the challenges is performed through two trial
runs with a total of 16 participants. Our preliminary results
show that the challenges are suitable for academia, and can
even potentially be included in official teaching curricula.
One major finding is an indicator of the lack of awareness of
secure coding by undergraduates. Finally, we compare our
results with previous work done in the industry and extract
advice for practitioners.

# Code of Conduct # {#coc}

The open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and expression
are central to the aims and goals of ICCQ; these require an environment
that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group, that
fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect, and that embraces
diversity. For these reasons, ICCQ is dedicated to providing
a harassment-free conference experience, and abides by the
[ACM Policy Against Discrimination and Harassment at ACM Activities](https://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/volunteer-resources/officers-manual/policy-against-discrimination-and-harassment).

Conference participants violating these standards may be sanctioned
or expelled from the conference, at the discretion of
the conference organizers. Conference organizers are requested
to report serious incidents to [abuse@iccq.ru](mailto:abuse@iccq.ru).
