## Student Research Competition

The SRC provides visibility and exposes up-and-coming researchers 
to the computer science community. On top of that, the competition
gives students an opportunity to receive a monetary support from
a leading tech company, motivating them to continue the study.

The competition is sponsored by 
[Huawei RRI](https://career.huawei.ru/rri/).

## How It Works?

You must be an undergraduate or a graduate student
in any university in Russia:

  1. You pick a research question from [the list](#questions) below;

  2. You research it and publish your results in any 
  conference or a journal sponsored by [ACM](https://www.acm.org) or [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org);

  3. You send us a link to your published paper, [by email](mailto:src@iccq.ru);

  4. We let [our judges](#judges) appraise it;

  5. We announce winners at the forthcoming [ICCQ conference](https://www.iccq.ru);

  6. Best papers get rewards of up to **$10,000**.

<span class="firebrick">NB!</span>
We publish all papers on this website, including non-winners.

## Research Questions # {#questions}

Here is a non-exhaustive list of research questions we expect you to
try finding answers for:

  * Can computers write code better than humans?

  * How source code can be refactored automatically (maybe using Machine Learning)?

  * How existing static analysis methods and tools can be improved?

  * How the process of coding via IDE can be optimized to increase the quality of code?

  * Can new programming techniques decrease the number of bugs humans make in the code?

  * Is it possible to objectively measure software quality?

  * Can some coding practices be formally proved to be harmful?

We are working on the list and more questions may be added to it later.

## Judges # {#judges}

These people are the appraisers:

  * [Giancarlo Succi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PdMO57sAAAAJ&hl=en), Innopolis University
<!--  * [Qianxiang Wang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37278378900), Huawei-->

We are still building the committee, the list will be extended soon.
