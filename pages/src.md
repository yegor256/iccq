## SRC

Currently our Student Research Competition (SRC) 
is sponsored by [Huawei RRI](https://career.huawei.ru/rri/).
The SRC provides visibility and exposes up-and-coming researchers 
to the computer science community. On top of that, the competition
gives students an opportunity to receive a monetary support from
a leading tech company, motivating them to continue the study.

## How It Works?

You must be an undergraduate or a graduate student:

  1. You pick a problem from [the list](#problems) below

  2. You research it and publish your results in any 
  conference or journal sponsored by [ACM](https://www.acm.org) or [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org)

  4. You submit your published paper to us, [by email](mailto:src@iccq.ru)

  5. We let [our judges](#judges) appraise it

  6. We announce winners at the forthcoming [ICCQ conference](https://www.iccq.ru)

  7. The best paper gets **$10,000**

  8. A few second-to-the-best papers get **$5,000**

<span class="firebrick">NB!</span>
We publish all papers on this website, including non-winners. 
We also publish our review results for each paper, in order
to help you better understand what is the next step of improvement.

## Problems # {#problems}

Here is a non-exhaustive list of problems we expect you to
try solving:

  * Can computers write code better than humans?

  * How source code can be refactored automatically (maybe using Machine Learning)?

  * How existing static analysis methods and tools can be improved?

  * How the process of coding via IDE can be optimized to increase the quality of code?

  * Can new programming techniques decrease the number of bugs humans make in code?

  * Can some coding practices be formally proved to be harmful?

We are working on the list and more problems will be added later.

## Judges # {#judges}

These people are the appraisers:

  * [Giancarlo Succi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PdMO57sAAAAJ&hl=en), Innopolis University
  * [Qianxiang Wang](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37278378900), Huawei

We are still building the committee, the list will be extended soon.
